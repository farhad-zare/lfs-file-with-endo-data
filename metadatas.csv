In order to study the effect of endotoxin on endothelial cell function, human lung microvascular endothelial cells in culture were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 10 ng, for 4, 8, or 24 hours and changes in mRNA expression were studied using Affymetrix HG U133plus2 gene arrays.  A principal components analysis revealed that LPS treatment was the primary source of variability in the data.  LPS treatment of endothelial cells for 4, 8, or 24 hours resulted in the upregulation by two-fold or greater of 275, 260 and 141 genes respectively.  LPS treatment resulted in the down regulation by 50% or greater of 176, 263 and 79 genes at 4, 8, or 24 hours respectively.  Up regulated genes at 4 or 8 hours were enriched in those encoding for cytokines, secreted proteins, cell membrane proteins and proteins controlling signal transduction and transcriptional regulation.

In this study, the mRNA expression profiles of endothelial cells (EC) exposed in vitro to IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, or; IFN-gamma were determined. We found that in HUVEC as well as in other EC types 175 genes were upregulated (>2-fold increase) by IFNs, including genes involved in the host response to RNA viruses, inflammation, and apoptosis. Interestingly, 41 genes showed a >5-fold higher induction by IFN-alpha in EC compared to human fibroblasts; among them, the gene encoding the angiostatic chemokine CXCL11 was selectively induced by IFN-alpha in EC along with other genes associated; with angiogenesis regulation, including CXCL10, TRAIL, and guanylate binding protein 1 (GBP-1). These transcriptional changes were confirmed and extended by quantitative PCR analysis and ELISA; whereas IFN-alpha and IFN-beta exerted virtually identical effects on transcriptome modulation, a differential gene regulation by type I and type II IFN emerged, especially as far as quantitative aspects were concerned. In vivo, IFN-alpha-producing tumors over-expressed murine CXCL10-11,; GBP-1 and TRAIL, with evidence of CXCL11 production by tumor-associated EC.

In this study, the mRNA expression profiles of endothelial cells (EC) exposed in vitro to IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, or; IFN-gamma were determined. We found that in HUVEC as well as in other EC types 175 genes were upregulated (>2-fold increase) by IFNs, including genes involved in the host response to RNA viruses, inflammation, and apoptosis. Interestingly, 41 genes showed a >5-fold higher induction by IFN-alpha in EC compared to human fibroblasts; among them, the gene encoding the angiostatic chemokine CXCL11 was selectively induced by IFN-alpha in EC along with other genes associated; with angiogenesis regulation, including CXCL10, TRAIL, and guanylate binding protein 1 (GBP-1). These transcriptional changes were confirmed and extended by quantitative PCR analysis and ELISA; whereas IFN-alpha and IFN-beta exerted virtually identical effects on transcriptome modulation, a differential gene regulation by type I and type II IFN emerged, especially as far as quantitative aspects were concerned. In vivo, IFN-alpha-producing tumors over-expressed murine CXCL10-11,; GBP-1 and TRAIL, with evidence of CXCL11 production by tumor-associated EC. Overall, these findings improve our understanding of the anti-angiogenic effects of IFNs by showing that these cytokines trigger an anti-angiogenic transcriptional program in EC. Moreover, we suggest that quantitative differences in the magnitude of the transcriptional activation of IFNresponsive genes could form the basis for cell-specific transcriptional signatures.

During all pregnancies, membrane enclosed extracellular vesicles derived from the syncytiotrophoblast are extruded into the maternal blood.The large size of these extracellular vesicles (diameter larger than 10µm) is referred to as trophoblastic debris in this study. We have shown in the past that endothleial cells are involved in clearence of this trophoblastic debris and induction of immune tolerence by trophoblastic debris.This study aimed to characterise the transcriptional changes that occur in human vascular endothelial cells following exposure to trophoblastic debris from normal first trimester placentae. Microarrays were used to probe transcriptomic changes 2 and 21 hours after exposure of endothelial cells (Human microvascular endothelial cell line,HMEC-1) to trophoblastic debris from normal first trimester placentae Trophoblastic debris were isolated by low speed centrifugation from three individual first trimester human placentae (three biological replicates). The protein content in trophoblastic debris was measured by BCA assay.

Interactions between glioblastoma (GBM) cells and endothelial cells (ECs) establish a purported stem cell niche. We hypothesized that genes that mediate these interactions would be important, particularly as therapeutic targets. Using a novel computational approach to deconvoluting expression data from mixed physical coculture of GBM cells and ECs, we identified upregulation of the cAMP specific phosphodiesterase PDE7B  in GBM cells in response to ECs. We further found that elevated PDE7B expression occurs in most GBM cases and has a negative effect on survival.  PDE7B overexpression resulted in the expansion of a stem-like cell subpopulation, increased tumor aggressiveness,  and increased growth in an intracranial GBM model.  This deconvolution algorithm provides a new tool for cancer biology, and these results identify PDE7B as a therapeutic target in GBM. 3 replicates from U87 monocultures, 3 replicates from HBMEC monocultures, 3 replicates from U87-HBMEC cocultures",Tumor endothelial cells,No

Our objective was to isolate clinically relevant quantities of fetal endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) from human term placenta and to compare them to the well-established donor-matched umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived ECFCs. A sorting strategy was devised to enrich for CD45-CD34+CD31Lo cells prior to primary plating to obtain pure placental ECFCs (PL-ECFCs) upon culture. UCB-ECFCs were derived using a well-described assay. PL-ECFCs were fetal in origin and expressed the same cell surface markers as UCB-ECFCs. Most importantly, a single term placenta could yield as many ECFCs as 27 UCB donors. PL-ECFCs and UCB-ECFCs had similar in vitro and in vivo vessel forming capacities and restored mouse hind limb ischemia in similar proportions. Gene expression profiles were only minimally divergent between PL-ECFCs and UCB-ECFCs, probably reflecting a vascular source versus a circulating source. Finally, PL-ECFCs and UCB-ECFCs displayed similar hierarchies between high and low proliferative colonies. We report a robust strategy to isolate ECFCs from human term placentas based on their cell surface expression. This yielded much larger quantities of ECFCs than UCB, but the cells were comparable in immunophenotype, gene expression, and in vivo functional ability. We conclude that PL-ECFCs have significant bio-banking and clinical translatability potential.

In atherosclerosis it is hypothesized that low density lipoproteins (LDL) that become trapped in the intima of the blood vessels are oxidized to minimally modified LDL (mmLDL) and that these serve as an important contributing factors to endothelial dysfunction. Oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (OX-PAPC), a model of the active phospholipid components of mmLDL affects the expression of hundreds of genes involved in inflammatory and other biological processes in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). We hypothesized that microRNAs (miRNAs) partially regulate this response. Using next generation sequencing, we identified miR-21-3p and miR-27a-5p to be induced 4-fold and 3-fold, respectively in response to OX-PAPC treatment compared to control treatment in HAECs. To identify the targets, we performed whole genome transcript profiling following transient over-expression of these two miRNAs followed by. In total, 1254 genes were down-regulated with 925 of them overlapping between the two miRNAs.

Although for some lncRNAs a relevant role in hypoxic endothelium has been shown, the regulation and function of lncRNAs is still largely unknown in the vascular physio-pathology. Taking advantage of next-generation sequencing techniques, transcriptomic changes induced by endothelial cell exposure to hypoxia were investigated. Paired-end sequencing of polyadenylated RNA derived from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to 1% O2 or normoxia was performed. Bioinformatics analysis identified ~2000 differentially expressed genes, including 122 lncRNAs. Extensive validation was performed by both microarray and qPCR. Among the validated lncRNAs, H19, MIR210HG, MEG9, MALAT1 and MIR22HG were also induced in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia. To test the functional relevance of lncRNAs in endothelial cells, knockdown of H19 expression was performed. H19 inhibition decreased HUVEC growth, inducing their accumulation in G1 phase of the cell cycle; accordingly, p21 (CDKN1A) expression was increased. Additionally, H19 knockdown also diminished HUVEC ability to form capillary like structures when plated on matrigel. In conclusion, a high-confidence signature of lncRNAs modulated by hypoxia in HUVEC was identified and a significant impact of H19 lncRNA was shown.

The two damage pathways trigger diverse and discriminative inflammatory and cytotoxic responses. Hp provides structural stabilization of Hb and shields Hbs oxidative reactions with lipoproteins providing dramatic protection against both pathways of toxicity. By these mechanisms Hp shifts Hbs destructive pseudo-peroxidative reaction into a potential anti-oxidative function during peroxidative stress.

Here, we show that the vertebrate transcriptional repressor Tel plays an evolutionarily conserved role in angiogenesis: it is indispensable for sprouting of primary human endothelial cells and for the normal development of the Danio rerio embryo blood circulatory system. Tel controls endothelial sprouting via binding to the generic co-repressor C-terminal binding protein (CtBP). In endothelial cells, the Tel:CtBP complex temporally restricts a VEGF-mediated pulse of dll4 expression and consequently integrates VEGFR intracellular signaling and intercellular Notch-Dll4 signaling. It further refines branching by regulating expression of other factors that constrain angiogenesis such as sprouty family members and ve-cadherin. Thus, the Tel:CtBP complex moderates the balance between positive and antagonistic angiogenesis cues and thereby conditions endothelial cells for angiogenesis. Since the activity of CtBP is attuned to intracellular NADH levels, our results raise the possibility that Tel-mediated sprouting could be sensitized to the metabolic status of the tissue. Tel control of branching appears to be evolutionarily conserved since Yan, the invertebrate orthologue of Tel, is similarly required for branching morphogenesis of the invertebrate tracheae. Collectively, our work suggests that Tel is a central regulator of angiogenesis and highlights Tel and its associated networks as potential targets for the development of therapeutic strategies to inhibit pathological angiogenesis. 2 independent screens were performed testing effects of knockdown of Tel or CtBP (screen 1) or effects of VEGF-A (screen 2) on Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs).

Here, we show that the vertebrate transcriptional repressor Tel plays an evolutionarily conserved role in angiogenesis: it is indispensable for sprouting of primary human endothelial cells and for the normal development of the Danio rerio embryo blood circulatory system. Tel controls endothelial sprouting via binding to the generic co-repressor C-terminal binding protein (CtBP). In endothelial cells, the Tel:CtBP complex temporally restricts a VEGF-mediated pulse of dll4 expression and consequently integrates VEGFR intracellular signaling and intercellular Notch-Dll4 signaling. It further refines branching by regulating expression of other factors that constrain angiogenesis such as sprouty family members and ve-cadherin. Thus, the Tel:CtBP complex moderates the balance between positive and antagonistic angiogenesis cues and thereby conditions endothelial cells for angiogenesis. Since the activity of CtBP is attuned to intracellular NADH levels, our results raise the possibility that Tel-mediated sprouting could be sensitized to the metabolic status of the tissue. Tel control of branching appears to be evolutionarily conserved since Yan, the invertebrate orthologue of Tel, is similarly required for branching morphogenesis of the invertebrate tracheae. Collectively, our work suggests that Tel is a central regulator of angiogenesis and highlights Tel and its associated networks as potential targets for the development of therapeutic strategies to inhibit pathological angiogenesis. 2 independent screens were performed testing effects of knockdown of Tel or CtBP (screen 1) or effects of VEGF-A (screen 2) on Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs). For screen 1 we tested 3 different conditions. We established stable HUVEC cell lines which were either infected with control lentivirus (Mock), or lentivirus expressing short hairpin RNA constructs for the specific knockdown of Tel(Teli) or CtBP2 (CtBP2i). Expression in the Teli and CtBP2i cell lines was compared to expression in the Mock cell line for screen 1. For screen 2 we tested 2 conditions. We exposed HUVECs to VEGF (50ng/mL) for 30 minutes (samplename: VEGF30) and compared the transcriptome of these cells to untreated HUVECs (VEGF0).

Objective: Chronic infection has long been postulated as a stimulus for atherogenesis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection has been associated with increased atherosclerosis in rats, and the bacteria produce a quorum sensing molecule 3-oxo-dodecynoyl-homoserine lactone (3OC12-HSL) that is critical for colonization and virulence.  Paraoxonase 2 (PON2) hydrolyzes 3OC12-HSL and also protects against the effects of oxidized phospholipids thought to contribute to atherosclerosis.  We now report the response of human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) to 3OC12-HSL and oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Ox-PAPC) in relation to PON2 expression. Methods and Results: Using expression profiling and network modeling, we identified the unfolded protein response (UPR), cell cycle genes, and the MAPK signaling pathway to be heavily involved in the HAEC response to 3OC12-HSL. The network also showed striking similarities to a network created based on HAEC response to Ox-PAPC, a major component of minimally-modified LDL.  HAEC in which PON2 was silenced by siRNA showed increased pro-inflammatory and UPR responses when treated with 3OC12-HSL or Ox-PAPC. Conclusion: 3OC12-HSL and Ox-PAPC influence similar inflammatory pathways.   Quorum sensing molecules such as 3OC12-HSL contribute to the pro-atherogenic effects of chronic infection and the anti-atherogenic effects of PON2 include destruction of quorum sensing molecules. 4 HAEC lines from different donors were treated with 3-O-C12 HSL or control (medium).",Atherosclerosis,No

Objective: Chronic infection has long been postulated as a stimulus for atherogenesis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection has been associated with increased atherosclerosis in rats, and the bacteria produce a quorum sensing molecule 3-oxo-dodecynoyl-homoserine lactone (3OC12-HSL) that is critical for colonization and virulence.  Paraoxonase 2 (PON2) hydrolyzes 3OC12-HSL and also protects against the effects of oxidized phospholipids thought to contribute to atherosclerosis.

In addition to mesenchymal cells, endothelial cell contribute to organ fibrosis through the process of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT).  Our aim was to investigate if human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMEC) can undergo EndoMT, produce extracellular matrix, and contribute to fibrosis in both forms of IBD.  Cellular transformation is a highly complex event involving drastic changes in multiple gene expression levels.  To assess global genomic changes accompanying HIMEC transformation, we performed microarray analysis comparing transformed to non-transformed/untreated HIMEC.  Consistent with the morphological, phenotypic and functional findings, transformed HIMEC downregulated the expression levels of genes typically expressed in endothelial cells and upregulated several genes of ECM molecules known to be increased in intestinal fibrosis.  Thus, it is evident that inflammatory stimuli induce transdifferentiation of HIMEC into matrix-producing mesenchymal cells. Because the conditions inducing transformation in vitro reproduce those found in vivo during active gut inflammation, the microvasculature may contribute to IBD-associated fibrosis through the novel process of EndoMT.  This series includes all treated or TRANSFORMED HIMEC samples (4).  Surgically resected specimens were used for isolation of human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMEC).

In addition to mesenchymal cells, endothelial cell contribute to organ fibrosis through the process of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT).  Our aim was to investigate if human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMEC) can undergo EndoMT, produce extracellular matrix, and contribute to fibrosis in both forms of IBD.  Cellular transformation is a highly complex event involving drastic changes in multiple gene expression levels.  To assess global genomic changes accompanying HIMEC transformation, we performed microarray analysis comparing transformed to non-transformed/untreated HIMEC.  Consistent with the morphological, phenotypic and functional findings, transformed HIMEC downregulated the expression levels of genes typically expressed in endothelial cells and upregulated several genes of ECM molecules known to be increased in intestinal fibrosis.  Thus, it is evident that inflammatory stimuli induce transdifferentiation of HIMEC into matrix-producing mesenchymal cells. Because the conditions inducing transformation in vitro reproduce those found in vivo during active gut inflammation, the microvasculature may contribute to IBD-associated fibrosis through the novel process of EndoMT.  This series includes all treated or TRANSFORMED HIMEC samples (4).  Surgically resected specimens were used for isolation of human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMEC).  HIMEC monolayers derived from intestinal mucosa of four different subjects: 2 controls, 1 ulcerative colitis, and 1 crohns were cultured in 75cm2 tissue culture flasks coated with fibronectin.  Cells were left untreated (unstimulated/non-transformed) or exposed to the combination of IL-1b 100 U/ml, TNF-a 100 U/ml and TGF-b1, 5ng/ml (TGFTNFIL1) for six days.  HIMEC medium was changed every 3 days.   Total ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted using a commercially available kit (Qiagen). RNA was reverse transcribed into cRNA which was then hybridized to the Illumina HumanRef-8 v2 Expression BeadChip.  The raw gene expression datasets were processed to remove outliers, log2 transformed and quantile normalized using R lumi software.  Those genes that satisfied the FDR p-value threshold of < 0.05 or raw p-value of <0.001 were identified as significant for the functional pathway and network analysis.",Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition | Heterogeneity | Infection and inflammatory response,No

Mutations in CCM1 can lead to the formation of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM). CCM lesions are frequent in the human population; however, their pathogenesis is poorly understood. This genome-wide expression analysis is aimed to unravelling novel mechanisms how CCM1 executes its functions in endothelial cells. We used human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as a model system to study CCM1 functions after adenoviral over expression. The results of this experiment suggest that CCM1 is a critical regulator of endothelial cell cycle control and proliferation as well as migration and angiogenesis. This fits well to the roles of CCM1 in HUVEC which indeed acts as a negative regulator of angiogenesis.

HUVECs were preconditioned to a baseline level of unidirectional shear of 15 dynes/cm2 for 24 hours. After 24 hours preconditioning, HUVECs were subjected to an arteriogenic stimulus that mimics the shear stress changes observed in the opposing entrance regions into a collateral artery network. The arteriogenic stimulus consisted of a 100% step wise increase in shear stress magnitude to a unidirectional 30 dynes/cm2 in either the same or opposite direction of the preconditioned shear stress. This simulates either the feeding entrance to the collateral artery circuit or the region that drains into the vasculature downstream of an obstruction in a major artery, respectively. In vivo analysis of collateral growth in the mouse hindlimb showed enhanced outward remodeling in the re-entrant (direction reversing) region that reconnects to the downstream arterial tree, suggesting reversal of shear stress direction as a key enhancer of arteriogenesis. Transcriptional profiling using microarray techniques identified that the reversal of shear stress direction, but not an increase in shear stress alone, yielded a broad-based enhancement of the mechanotransduction pathways necessary for the induction of arteriogenesis. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were preconditioned to a unidirectional clockwise shear stress of 15 dynes/cm2 for 24 hours.

An acute increase in shear stress magnitude to 30 dynes/cm2 in either a clockwise (non-reversed) or counter-clockwise (reversed) direction was applied for 6 hours. An additional preconditioned control culture was maintained under a unidirectional clockwise shear stress of 15 dynes/cm2 and harvested at the same time point, 6 hours post-conditioning.

They exert beneficial cardiovascular effects independently of blood pressure lowering and classic mechanisms of action. In this study, we investigate molecular mechanisms responsible for the off-target effects of telmisartan and telmisartan-amlodipine in endothelial cells (EC), using an unbiased approach. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, microarray analysis of gene expression followed by pathway enrichment analysis and qRT-PCR validation revealed that telmisartan modulates the expression of key genes responsible for cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Amlodipine effect was similar to control. EC exposed to telmisartan, but not amlodipine, losartan or valsartan, exhibited a dose-dependent impairment of cell growth and failed to enter the S-phase of the cell cycle. Similarly, telmisartan inhibited proliferation in COS-7 cells lacking the AT1 receptor. In telmisartan-treated EC, phosphorylation and activation of Akt as well as MDM2 was reduced, leading to accumulation of p53 in the nucleus, where it represses the transcription of cell cycle promoting genes. Phosphorylation of GSK3 was also reduced, resulting in rapid proteolytic turnover of CyclinD1. Telmisartan induced downregulation of proapoptotic genes and protected EC from serum starvation- and 7-ketocholesterol-induced apoptosis. Telmisartan exerts antiproliferative and antiapoptotic effects in EC. This may account for the improved endothelial dysfunction observed in the clinical setting.

Yet, the mechanisms by which biophysical properties of extracellular matrix relate to metabolic processes and downstream PH phenotypes remain undefined. In cultured endothelial and smooth muscle cells and confirmed in PH-diseased human samples, we found that ECM stiffening activates the mechanosensitive factors YAP/TAZ to increase glycolysis and induce glutaminase (GLS) expression and glutaminolysis. Glutaminolysis replenishes aspartate for anabolic biosynthesis, thus sustaining proliferation and migration within stiff ECM. In vitro GLS inhibition blocks aspartate production, consequently reprogramming entire cellular proliferative pathways, while aspartate restores proliferation. In a rat model in vivo, GLS inhibition prevents hemodynamic and histologic manifestations of PH. Thus, mechanical ECM stiffening sustains vascular cell growth and migration through YAP/TAZ-dependent glutaminolysis  a paradigm that advances our understanding of the connections of mechanical stimuli with dysregulated vascular metabolism and identifies new metabolic drug targets in PH. We used microarrays to decipher the global program of gene expression involved in response to matrix stiffening and determined the implication of glutaminolysis (GLS) in these process PAECs were transfected with an siRNA control (siNC) or a siRNA against GLS (siGLS) and cultivated on soft hydrogel (1kPa) or stiff hydrogel (50kPa).

Cigarette smoke (CS) has been shown to contribute to the monocyte-endothelial adhesion process. Yet, the complex mechanisms underlying this event remain to be discovered. In the systemic compartment, monocytes and endothelial cells are exposed primarily to soluble constituents originating from the inhaled CS and absorbed through the lung alveolar epithelium and the adjacent microvascular endothelium. Considering this rationale, we developed an in vitro adhesion assay, intending to mimic the in vivo situation, to deeply investigate the impact of CS on the adhesion of monocytic cell to the endothelium. Using a transcriptomics approach followed by confirmation experiments, we were able to identify a key mechanism by which aqueous extract of CS (smoke-bubbled Phosphate Buffered Saline, sbPBS) promotes the adhesion of monocytic Mono Mac 6 (MM6) cells to the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). While CS-derived constituents directly provoke a strong oxidative stress response in both cell types, the induced expression of E-selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 adhesion molecules, responsible for the binding of MM6 cells to HUVECs, occurs through a proinflammatory paracrine effect. We demonstrate that this effect is mainly driven by TNF? produced by MM6 cells exposed to sbPBS.

The (epi)genetic regulatory mechanisms underlying this heterogeneity in human EC are incompletely understood. Using genome-wide microarray screening we established a specific fingerprint of freshly isolated arterial (HUAEC) and venous EC (HUVEC) from human umbilical cord comprising 64 arterial and 12 venous genes, representing distinct functions and pathways. Among the arterial genes were 8 transcription factors, including HEY2, a downstream target of Notch signaling and the current golden standard pathway for arterial EC specification. Short-term culture of HUAEC or HUVEC abrogated differential gene expression resulting in a default state. Erasure of arterial gene expression was at least in part due to loss of canonical Notch activity and HEY2 expression. Notably, nCounter analysis revealed that restoring HEY2 expression or Delta-like 4 (Dll4)-induced Notch signaling in cultured HUVEC or HUAEC only partially reinstated the arterial EC gene signature while combined overexpression of the 8 transcription factors restored this fingerprint much more robustly. Each transcription factor had a different impact on gene regulation, with some stimulating only few and others boosting a large proportion of arterial genes. Interestingly, although there was some overlap and cross-regulation, the transcription factors largely complemented each other in regulating the arterial EC gene profile.

The (epi)genetic regulatory mechanisms underlying this heterogeneity in human EC are incompletely understood. Using genome-wide microarray screening we established a specific fingerprint of freshly isolated arterial (HUAEC) and venous EC (HUVEC) from human umbilical cord comprising 64 arterial and 12 venous genes, representing distinct functions and pathways. Among the arterial genes were 8 transcription factors, including HEY2, a downstream target of Notch signaling and the current golden standard pathway for arterial EC specification. Short-term culture of HUAEC or HUVEC abrogated differential gene expression resulting in a default state. Erasure of arterial gene expression was at least in part due to loss of canonical Notch activity and HEY2 expression. Notably, nCounter analysis revealed that restoring HEY2 expression or Delta-like 4 (Dll4)-induced Notch signaling in cultured HUVEC or HUAEC only partially reinstated the arterial EC gene signature while combined overexpression of the 8 transcription factors restored this fingerprint much more robustly.

Inhibition of Erg expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) resulted in decreased migration in vitro, whilst Erg over-expression using adenovirus caused increased migration. Live-cell imaging of Erg-deficient HUVEC showed a reduction in lamellipodia, in line with decreased motility. Both actin and tubulin cytoskeletons were disrupted in Erg-deficient EC, with a dramatic increase in tubulin acetylation. Amongst the most significant microarray hit was the cytosolic histone deacetylase (HDAC)-6, a regulator of cell migration. Rescue experiments confirmed that HDAC6 mediates the Erg-dependent regulation of tubulin acetylation and actin localization. The functional role of Erg in EC was studied by gene expressing profiling using three separate HUVEC isolates treated with either control antisense or Erg-specific antisense for 24 or 48 hours.",Angiogenesis,No

Combined treatment with IL-4 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- alpha resulted in further, sustained induction of VCAM-1 expression. IL-4-mediated induction of VCAM-1 and secondary monocyte adhesion was predominantly regulated by the transcription factor, STAT6. Genome-wide survey of IL-4-mediated STAT6 binding from sequential chromatin-immunoprecipitation with deep-sequencing (ChIP-seq) in endothelial cells revealed regions of transient and sustained transcription factor binding. By combining DNA microarrays and ChIP-seq at the same time points, the majority of IL-4-responsive genes were shown to be STAT6-dependent and associated with direct STAT6 binding to their promoter. IL-4-mediated stable binding of STAT6 led to sustained target gene expression. Moreover, our strategy led to the identification of a novel functionally important STAT6 binding site within -16 kb upstream of the VCAM-1 gene.

IL-4-mediated induction of VCAM-1 and secondary monocyte adhesion was predominantly regulated by the transcription factor, STAT6. Genome-wide survey of IL-4-mediated STAT6 binding from sequential chromatin-immunoprecipitation with deep-sequencing (ChIP-seq) in endothelial cells revealed regions of transient and sustained transcription factor binding. By combining DNA microarrays and ChIP-seq at the same time points, the majority of IL-4-responsive genes were shown to be STAT6-dependent and associated with direct STAT6 binding to their promoter. IL-4-mediated stable binding of STAT6 led to sustained target gene expression. Moreover, our strategy led to the identification of a novel functionally important STAT6 binding site within -16 kb upstream of the VCAM-1 gene. Taken together, these findings support a critical role for STAT6 in mediating IL-4 signal transduction in endothelial cells. Identification of a novel IL-4-mediated VCAM-1 enhancer may provide a foundation for targeted therapy in vascular disease (ChIP-seq data not submitted to GEO).

Moreover, the receptor tyrosine kinase ligand Ephrin-A3 was identified as one functionally relevant target. Since each miRNA regulates hundreds of mRNAs, different approaches were combined to identify new miR-210 targets: a Using target prediction software, 32 new miR-210 potential targets were identified. b The proteomic profiling of miR-210 over-expressing ECs identified 11 proteins that were specifically inhibited by miR-210, either directly or indirectly. c Affymetrix based gene expression profiles identified 51 genes that were both down-modulated by miR-210 over-expression and de-repressed when miR-210 was blocked.

Previously, we demonstrated that miR-210 is a key player of endothelial cell (EC) response to hypoxia, modulating EC survival, migration and ability to form capillary like-structures. Moreover, the receptor tyrosine kinase ligand Ephrin-A3 was identified as one functionally relevant target. Since each miRNA regulates hundreds of mRNAs, different approaches were combined to identify new miR-210 targets: a Using target prediction software, 32 new miR-210 potential targets were identified. b The proteomic profiling of miR-210 over-expressing ECs identified 11 proteins that were specifically inhibited by miR-210, either directly or indirectly. c Affymetrix based gene expression profiles identified 51 genes that were both down-modulated by miR-210 over-expression and de-repressed when miR-210 was blocked. Surprisingly, only few genes identified either by proteomics or transcriptomics were recognized as miR-210 targets by target prediction algorithms. However, a low-stringency pairing research revealed enrichment for miR-210 putative binding sites, raising the possibility that these genes were targeted via non-canonical recognition sequences. To clarify this issue, miR-210-loaded RISC was purified by immuno-precipitation along with its mRNA targets. The presence of Ephrin-A3 mRNA in the complex validated this approach. We found that 32 potential targets were indeed enriched in miR-210-loaded RISC, and thus can be considered as genuine miR-210 targets.

Since cellular uptake of N-octanoyl dopamine (NOD) is far better than of dopamine, NOD might display anti-inflammatory effects already at relative low concentrations. The present study was conducted to assess the anti-inflammatory potential of NOD and to elucidate how this was mediated.  Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were stimulated with TNF-alfa in the presence of various NOD concentrations. Affymetrix gene expression profiling (GEP), Western blotting, adhesion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to endothelial cells and NF?B activation was studied. Compounds that were structurally related to NOD were used to address the molecular entities within NOD that were required for its anti-inflammatory properties.  Results: GEP revealed that NOD down-regulates a wide range of pro-inflammatory mediators. Down-regulation of adhesion molecules was confirmed at the protein level and resulted in a decreased adhesion of PBMC to endothelial cells under static and flow conditions. NOD inhibited NF?B independently ofI?B? degradation. Inhibition was associated with an overall decrease in p65 expression and a significant decrease in p65 phosphorylation at Ser276.

Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of alternative mechanisms of FoxO-dependent gene expression beyond classical binding to a FoxO-responsive DNA binding element (FRE). Here we explored the relative contribution of those mechanisms by comparing the transcriptional responses to conditional activation of FoxO3 and a corresponding FRE-binding mutant in primary human endothelial cells. Microarray analysis revealed several functional gene clusters regulated in absence of an intact DNA-binding domain. Notably, both mutants triggered apoptosis albeit with different efficiencies. This was associated with regulation of overlapping and distinct proapototic gene clusters. Subsequent analysis demonstrated important roles for the Bcl2-like family members BIM and NOXA in this process. Remarkably, BIM was effectively induced by the FoxO3 FRE-binding mutant and BIM depletion could rescue its proapoptotic effect.  Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of alternatively regulated FoxO3 targets in primary cells and underscores the importance of such genes for endothelial function and integrity.

Microarray analysis revealed several functional gene clusters regulated in absence of an intact DNA-binding domain. Notably, both mutants triggered apoptosis albeit with different efficiencies. This was associated with regulation of overlapping and distinct proapototic gene clusters. Subsequent analysis demonstrated important roles for the Bcl2-like family members BIM and NOXA in this process. Remarkably, BIM was effectively induced by the FoxO3 FRE-binding mutant and BIM depletion could rescue its proapoptotic effect.

The molecular mechanisms of trefoil factors, initiators of mucosal healing and being greatly involved in tumorigenesis, have remained elusive. A naturally existing 72-kDa complex of non-lens bg-crystallin (a-subunit) and trefoil factor (b-subunit), named bg-CAT, was identified from frog Bombina maxima skin secretions. Its a-subunit and b-subunit (containing three trefoil factor domains), with a non-covalently linked form of ab2, show significant sequence homology to ep37 proteins, a group of non-lens bg-crystallins identified in newt Cynops pyrrhogaster and mammalian trefoil factors, respectively. The bg-CAT showed multiple cellular effects on human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Low dosages of bg-CAT (25-50 pM) were able to stimulate cell migration and wound healing. At high concentrations, it induced cell detachment (EC50 10 nM) and apoptosis. The bg-CAT was rapidly endocytosed via intracellular vacuole formation. Under confocal microscope, some of the vacuoles were translocated to nucleus and partially fused with nuclear membrane.  However, what exactly target of bg-CAT act on HUVECs nuclear is still unknown. Primary cultured HUVECs treated with bg-CAT (25 nM, 2 h) were selected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain the genome wide level of significant differential gene expression induced by bg-CAT on HUVECs in order to get clues about bg-CAT action mechanisms. These findings illustrate novel cellular functions of non-lens bg-cyrstallins and action mechanism via association with trefoil factors, serving as clues for investigating the possible occurrence of similar molecules and action mechanisms in mammals. Experiment Overall Design: We used microarrays to analysis genome wide level of significant differential gene expression induced by bg-CAT on HUVECs.Four independent biological replicates of HUVECs treated with bg-CAT (25 nM, 2 h) were compared with normal control by SAM. The significant differential expression of 123 genes.  121 genes were up-regulated, among which members of nuclear receptor subfamily 4 (NR4A) were the most prominent. Only 2 genes were down-regulated (including collagen type I) (Supporting information Fig. S1 and Table S1 in accompanying publication). Members of NR4A exhibit differential roles in determining cell growth or cell death depending on its location in the nucleus or mitochondria. NR4A1 (also called Nur77, TR3) mediates cell apoptosis through translocation from nucleus to mitochondria and induction of cytochrome c releasing . Significant activation of NR4A members suggests these orphan nuclear receptors may be involved in the mediation of bg-CAT biological functions, like proapoptotic action of the protein at high concentrations.

Here we demonstrate that the calcineurin-NFAT pathway is activated specifically in lung endothelium prior to the detection of tumor cells that preferentially metastasize to the lung. We previously showed that DSCR-1 functions in a negative feedback loop to attenuate calcineurin signaling. Upregulation of the calcineurin pathway via loss of Dscr-1 leads to a significant increase in lung metastasis due to the increased expression of a newly identified NFAT target, Angiopoietin (Ang)-2. An increase in VEGF levels specifically in the lung versus other organ microenvironments triggers a threshold of calcineurin-NFAT signaling that transactivates Ang2 in lung endothelium.

Whole lung total RNA were harvested from wildtype or Dscr-1 null mutation mice (C57BL6/J background), and subjected to Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 array in duplicate conditions. Alternatively, primary cultured human lung endothelial cells (LONZA) were transfected with either siRNA, control or DSCR-1, or adenovirus expressing DSCR-1 or mock control.

Here we demonstrate that the calcineurin-NFAT pathway is activated specifically in lung endothelium prior to the detection of tumor cells that preferentially metastasize to the lung. We previously showed that DSCR-1 functions in a negative feedback loop to attenuate calcineurin signaling. Upregulation of the calcineurin pathway via loss of Dscr-1 leads to a significant increase in lung metastasis due to the increased expression of a newly identified NFAT target, Angiopoietin (Ang)-2. An increase in VEGF levels specifically in the lung versus other organ microenvironments triggers a threshold of calcineurin-NFAT signaling that transactivates Ang2 in lung endothelium. Further, we demonstrate that overexpression of DSCR-1 or the Ang-2 receptor, soluble Tie2, prevents activation of the lung endothelium inhibiting lung metastases in our mouse models.

The miR-17-92 cluster (encoding miR-17, -18a, -19a/b, -20a and miR-92a) is highly expressed in tumor cells and is up-regulated by ischemia. Whereas miR-92a was recently identified as negative regulator of angiogenesis, the specific functions of the other members of the cluster are less clear. Here we demonstrate that overexpression of miR-17, -18a, -19a and -20a significantly inhibited 3D spheroid sprouting in vitro, whereas inhibition of miR-17, -18a and -20a augmented endothelial cell (EC) sprout formation. Inhibition of miR-17 and miR-20a in vivo using antagomirs significantly increased the number of perfused vessels in matrigel plugs, whereas antagomirs, that specifically target miR-18a and miR-19a were less effective. However, systemic inhibition of miR-17/20 did not affect tumor angiogenesis. Further mechanistic studies showed that miR-17/20 targets several pro-angiogenic genes. Specifically, Janus kinase 1 (Jak1) was shown to be a direct target of miR-17. In summary, we show that miR-17/20 exhibit a cell intrinsic anti-angiogenic activity in ECs.

To investigate the differential role of class IIa HDACs for the regulation of angiogenesis, we used siRNA to specifically suppress the individual HDAC isoenzymes. Among the HDAC isoforms tested, silencing of HDAC5 exhibited a unique pro-angiogenic effect evidenced by increased endothelial cell migration, sprouting and tube formation. Consistently, overexpression of HDAC5 decreased sprout formation, indicating that HDAC5 is a negative regulator of angiogenesis. The anti-angiogenic activity of HDAC5 was independent of MEF2 binding and its deacetylase activity, but required a nuclear localization indicating that HDAC5 might affect the transcriptional regulation of gene expression. To identify putative HDAC5 targets, we performed microarray expression analysis. Silencing of HDAC5 increased the expression of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and angiogenic guidance factors including Slit2. Antagonization of FGF2 or Slit2 reduced sprout induction in response to HDAC5 siRNA. ChIP assays demonstrate that HDAC5 binds to the promoter of FGF2 and Slit2. In summary, HDAC5 represses angiogenic genes, like FGF2 and Slit2, which causally contribute to capillary-like sprouting of endothelial cells.

The difference in gene expression profile between human endometrial endothelial cells (HEECs) from eutopic endometria of patients with and without endometriosis would be determinant that affects the occurrence of endometriosis. To explore this kind of difference, we performed in vitro culture and identified their endothelial origin, as well as observed growth features of HEECs from the two different origins. Finally we identified the difference in gene expression profile when combined suppression subtractive hybridization(SSH) with genechip and confirmed the results by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The HEECs derived from endometriosis exhibited potent survival ability in vitro compared to that from non-endometriosis. We found that gremlin and fibronectin genes were up-regulated in HEECs derived from eutopic endometrium of patients with endometriosis when compared with that from patients without endometriosis.

The genome of Kaposis sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes a cluster of twelve miRNAs, which are abundantly expressed during both latency and lytic infection. Relatively few cellular targets of KSHV miRNAs are known. Here, we used a microarray expression profiling approach to analyze the transcriptome of both B lymphocytes and endothelial cells stably expressing KSHV miRNAs and monitor the changes induced by the presence of these miRNAs. We generated a list of potential cellular targets by looking for miRNA seed-match-containing transcripts that were significantly down regulated upon KSHV miRNAs expression. Interestingly, the overlap of putative targets identified in B lymphocytes and endothelial cells was minimal, suggesting a tissue-specific target-regulation by viral miRNAs. Among the putative targets, we identified caspase 3, a critical factor for the control of apoptosis, which we validated using luciferase reporter assays and western blotting.

We profiled gene expression of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) exposed to ultrafine Chapel Hill particles (UFP) (100?g/ml) or vehicle for 4h with Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 chips (N = 4 each). Using an unpaired t-test (p <0.01, 5% false discovery rate) we found 426 unique genes to be differentially expressed with 320 upregulated genes and 106 downregulated genes. Among these genes, we noted upregulation of genes related to coagulation-inflammation circuitry including tissue factor (F3), coagulation factor II receptor-like 2 (F2RL2, PAR3), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8. Upregulation of these genes were independently confirmed by RT-PCR and/or protein release. Genes related to the CXC chemokine family that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular disease were upregulated, including MCP-1 (2.60 fold), IL-8 (2.47 fold), CXCL1 (1.41 fold), CXCL2 (1.95 fold), CXCL3 (2.28 fold) and CXCR4 (1.30 fold). In addition, genes related to clotting independent signaling of F3 were also differentially expressed, including FOS, JUN and NFKBIA. Treatment of HPAEC with UFP for 16 hours increased the release of IL6 and IL8 by 1.9-fold and 1.8-fold respectively. Pretreatment of HPAEC with a blocking antibody against F3 attenuated IL6 and IL8 release by 30% and 70% respectively. Thus using gene profiling, we uncovered that UFP may induce vascular endothelial cells to express genes related to clotting and angiogenesis. These results provide a novel hypothesis that PM may cause cardiovascular adverse health effects via induction of tissue factor in vascular endothelial cells which then triggers clotting dependent and independent downstream signaling.

We speculated that viral infection of the pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells could cause the angioproliferative phenotype characteristic of severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We now demonstrate the ability of HHV-8 to infect human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVECs) in vitro, confirming both latent and lytic infection. HHV-8 infection of HPMVECs resulted in significant changes of gene expression including alterations of pathways integral to both cellular apoptosis and angiogenesis. This infection also results in alterations of genes integral to the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) pathway, including down regulation of bone morphogenic protein receptor 1a (BMPR1a) and bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4). Other genes previously implicated in the development of PAH are also altered in expression by HHV-8 infection. These include increased expression of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-1, MMP-2 and MMP-10. Lastly, cells infected with HHV-8 apoptosis resistant. Infection of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells with human herepesvirus-8 results in alteration of the BMP pathway as well as an anti-apoptotic phenotype, consistent with the development of plexiform lesions characteristic of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Experiment Overall Design:  Direct comparison of HHV8-infected and mock-infected human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. Experiment Overall Design:  Triplicate infection and mock infection samples were prepared. One hybridization per sample, 6 total hybridizations Experiment Overall Design:  Single channel hybridization (no reference).",Angiogenesis | Kaposi sarcoma,No

Methods: Human EC derived from corpus cavernosum (HCCEC, n=5), coronary artery (HCAEC, n=4) and umbilical vein (HUVEC, n=3) were grown in culture and mRNA transcripts quantified by Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays. Genes differentially expressed across samples were partitioned around medoids to identify genes with highest expression in HCCEC. Several genes were verified by real-time PCR. The role of claudin 11 (CLDN11) in endothelial cell barrier function was examined by in vitro transendothelial electrical resistance assay. Results: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of samples using all expressed genes yielded discrete groupings of EC lines according to their in vivo source of origin. 190 genes/transcripts were highly expressed only in cavernosal HCCEC. Gene Ontology classification indicated cavernosal enrichment in genes related to cell adhesion, extracellular matrix (ECM), pattern specification and organogenesis. KEGG pathway analysis showed high expression of gene relating to ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesions, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. Real-time PCR confirmed expression differences in cadherins 2 and 11, CLDN11, desmoplakin and versican. CLDN11, a component of tight junctions not previously described in ECs, was highly expressed only in HCCEC and its knockdown by siRNA significantly reduced transendothelial electrical resistance in HCCEC. Conclusions: HCCECs displayed expression of transcripts encoding matrix and adhesion proteins that regulate structural and functional characteristics of blood vessels. High expression of the tight junction protein CLDN11 is novel in endothelial cells and  contributes to barrier function of cultured HCCEC. Experiment Overall Design: Endothelial cells were grown on 2% gelatin type B (Sigma)/15% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) coated tissue culture dishes in Medium 199 (Gibco) supplemented with 20% FBS, EGM-2MV (Clonetics), L-glutamine and 10,000u/ml Penicillin, 10,000u/ml Streptomycin, and 25mg/ml Fungizone. All cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 oC and 5% CO2 with media changed every 2-3 days. Total RNA isolation for the arrays was performed using Qiagen RNeasy mini columns according to manufacturers instructions (RNeasy Mini Handbook). Briefly, cells grown in T-75 culture flasks were trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin/1 mM EDTA (Gibco) between the third and seventh passages and centrifuged to pellet the cells. Next, cells were disrupted and homogenized in RNeasy lysis buffer using a 1ml syringe with 21-gauge needle. Ethanol was added to allow binding of RNA to the silica-gel-based membrane of the mini column. Several washes as well as on-column DNase treatment were used to ensure that contaminants and DNA were effectively removed from the column. Finally, RNA was eluted in approximately 30ul of RNase free water. Experiment Overall Design: Biotin labeled target cRNA was prepared according to the Affymetrix eukaryotic target labeling protocol starting with 5ug total RNA for each sample.

Experiment Overall Design: Endothelial cells were grown on 2% gelatin type B (Sigma)/15% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) coated tissue culture dishes in Medium 199 (Gibco) supplemented with 20% FBS, EGM-2MV (Clonetics), L-glutamine and 10,000u/ml Penicillin, 10,000u/ml Streptomycin, and 25mg/ml Fungizone. All cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 oC and 5% CO2 with media changed every 2-3 days. Total RNA isolation for the arrays was performed using Qiagen RNeasy mini columns according to manufacturers instructions (RNeasy Mini Handbook). Briefly, cells grown in T-75 culture flasks were trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin/1 mM EDTA (Gibco) between the third and seventh passages and centrifuged to pellet the cells. Next, cells were disrupted and homogenized in RNeasy lysis buffer using a 1ml syringe with 21-gauge needle. Ethanol was added to allow binding of RNA to the silica-gel-based membrane of the mini column. Several washes as well as on-column DNase treatment were used to ensure that contaminants and DNA were effectively removed from the column. Finally, RNA was eluted in approximately 30ul of RNase free water. Experiment Overall Design: Biotin labeled target cRNA was prepared according to the Affymetrix eukaryotic target labeling protocol starting with 5ug total RNA for each sample. Each target was hybridized to an Affymetrix Human U133A GeneChip. GeneChips were washed and scanned at the University of Washington Center for Expression Arrays according to procedures developed by the manufacturer.",Heterogeneity | Barrier | Tight junctionss,No

Methods: Human EC derived from corpus cavernosum (HCCEC, n=5), coronary artery (HCAEC, n=4) and umbilical vein (HUVEC, n=3) were grown in culture and mRNA transcripts quantified by Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays. Genes differentially expressed across samples were partitioned around medoids to identify genes with highest expression in HCCEC. Several genes were verified by real-time PCR. The role of claudin 11 (CLDN11) in endothelial cell barrier function was examined by in vitro transendothelial electrical resistance assay. Results: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of samples using all expressed genes yielded discrete groupings of EC lines according to their in vivo source of origin. 190 genes/transcripts were highly expressed only in cavernosal HCCEC. Gene Ontology classification indicated cavernosal enrichment in genes related to cell adhesion, extracellular matrix (ECM), pattern specification and organogenesis. KEGG pathway analysis showed high expression of gene relating to ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesions, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. Real-time PCR confirmed expression differences in cadherins 2 and 11, CLDN11, desmoplakin and versican. CLDN11, a component of tight junctions not previously described in ECs, was highly expressed only in HCCEC and its knockdown by siRNA significantly reduced transendothelial electrical resistance in HCCEC.

KEGG pathway analysis showed high expression of gene relating to ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesions, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. Real-time PCR confirmed expression differences in cadherins 2 and 11, CLDN11, desmoplakin and versican. CLDN11, a component of tight junctions not previously described in ECs, was highly expressed only in HCCEC and its knockdown by siRNA significantly reduced transendothelial electrical resistance in HCCEC. Conclusions: HCCECs displayed expression of transcripts encoding matrix and adhesion proteins that regulate structural and functional characteristics of blood vessels. High expression of the tight junction protein CLDN11 is novel in endothelial cells and  contributes to barrier function of cultured HCCEC. Experiment Overall Design: Endothelial cells were grown on 2% gelatin type B (Sigma)/15% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) coated tissue culture dishes in Medium 199 (Gibco) supplemented with 20% FBS, EGM-2MV (Clonetics), L-glutamine and 10,000u/ml Penicillin, 10,000u/ml Streptomycin, and 25mg/ml Fungizone. All cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 oC and 5% CO2 with media changed every 2-3 days. Total RNA isolation for the arrays was performed using Qiagen RNeasy mini columns according to manufacturers instructions (RNeasy Mini Handbook). Briefly, cells grown in T-75 culture flasks were trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin/1 mM EDTA (Gibco) between the third and seventh passages and centrifuged to pellet the cells. Next, cells were disrupted and homogenized in RNeasy lysis buffer using a 1ml syringe with 21-gauge needle. Ethanol was added to allow binding of RNA to the silica-gel-based membrane of the mini column. Several washes as well as on-column DNase treatment were used to ensure that contaminants and DNA were effectively removed from the column. Finally, RNA was eluted in approximately 30ul of RNase free water. Experiment Overall Design: Biotin labeled target cRNA was prepared according to the Affymetrix eukaryotic target labeling protocol starting with 5ug total RNA for each sample. Each target was hybridized to an Affymetrix Human U133A GeneChip. GeneChips were washed and scanned at the University of Washington Center for Expression Arrays according to procedures developed by the manufacturer.",Heterogeneity | Barrier | Tight junctionss,No

This study addresses the possibility that genetic differences affecting the biology of the vascular endothelium could be a factor contributing to this health disparity. Methods: From self-identified, healthy, 20-29 year old AA (n=21) and CA (n=17), we established cultures of blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOEC) and applied microarray profiling. BOEC have never been exposed to in vivo influences, and their gene expression reflects culture conditions (meticulously controlled) and donor genetics. Analysis used two distinct approaches. Significance Analysis of Microarray, a FDR-based test, identified significant differential expression of single genes. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis examined expression of pre-determined gene sets that survey each of nine biological systems relevant to endothelial cell biology. Results: At the highly stringent threshold of FDR=0, we identified 31 single genes that were differentially expressed, 4 higher and 27 lower in AA. AA exhibited the greatest fold-change (AA>CA), but this was entirely accounted for by a homolog (PSPHL) hidden within the PSPH probe set. Among other significantly different genes were: for AA>CA, SOS1, AMFR, FGFR3; and for AA<CA, ARVCF, BIN3, EIF4B. Many more (221 transcripts for 204 genes) were differentially expressed at the more customary, less stringent threshold of FDR<.05. Using the biological systems approach, we identified shear response biology as being significantly altered for AA versus CA. It detected an apparent tonic increase of expression (AA>CA) for 46/157 genes within that system. Conclusions: The most significant single gene changes detected for AA involved genes having substantial, known roles in endothelial biology. Biological systems analysis suggested that shear stress response, a critical regulator of endothelial function and vascular homeostasis, may be different between AA and CA. These results potentially have direct implications for the role of endothelial cells in both vascular disease (e.g., hypertension and stroke) and cancer (via angiogenesis). The present findings are consistent with our overarching hypothesis that genetic influences stemming from ancestral continent-of-origin could impact upon endothelial cell biology and thereby contribute to disparity of vascular-related disease burden amongst AA.

It detected an apparent tonic increase of expression (AA>CA) for 46/157 genes within that system. Conclusions: The most significant single gene changes detected for AA involved genes having substantial, known roles in endothelial biology. Biological systems analysis suggested that shear stress response, a critical regulator of endothelial function and vascular homeostasis, may be different between AA and CA. These results potentially have direct implications for the role of endothelial cells in both vascular disease (e.g., hypertension and stroke) and cancer (via angiogenesis).

This study addresses the possibility that genetic differences affecting the biology of the vascular endothelium could be a factor contributing to this health disparity. Methods: From self-identified, healthy, 20-29 year old AA (n=21) and CA (n=17), we established cultures of blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOEC) and applied microarray profiling. BOEC have never been exposed to in vivo influences, and their gene expression reflects culture conditions (meticulously controlled) and donor genetics. Analysis used two distinct approaches. Significance Analysis of Microarray, a FDR-based test, identified significant differential expression of single genes. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis examined expression of pre-determined gene sets that survey each of nine biological systems relevant to endothelial cell biology. Results: At the highly stringent threshold of FDR=0, we identified 31 single genes that were differentially expressed, 4 higher and 27 lower in AA. AA exhibited the greatest fold-change (AA>CA), but this was entirely accounted for by a homolog (PSPHL) hidden within the PSPH probe set. Among other significantly different genes were: for AA>CA, SOS1, AMFR, FGFR3; and for AA<CA, ARVCF, BIN3, EIF4B. Many more (221 transcripts for 204 genes) were differentially expressed at the more customary, less stringent threshold of FDR<.05. Using the biological systems approach, we identified shear response biology as being significantly altered for AA versus CA. It detected an apparent tonic increase of expression (AA>CA) for 46/157 genes within that system. Conclusions: The most significant single gene changes detected for AA involved genes having substantial, known roles in endothelial biology. Biological systems analysis suggested that shear stress response, a critical regulator of endothelial function and vascular homeostasis, may be different between AA and CA. These results potentially have direct implications for the role of endothelial cells in both vascular disease (e.g., hypertension and stroke) and cancer (via angiogenesis). The present findings are consistent with our overarching hypothesis that genetic influences stemming from ancestral continent-of-origin could impact upon endothelial cell biology and thereby contribute to disparity of vascular-related disease burden amongst AA.

Significance Analysis of Microarray, a FDR-based test, identified significant differential expression of single genes. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis examined expression of pre-determined gene sets that survey each of nine biological systems relevant to endothelial cell biology. Results: At the highly stringent threshold of FDR=0, we identified 31 single genes that were differentially expressed, 4 higher and 27 lower in AA. AA exhibited the greatest fold-change (AA>CA), but this was entirely accounted for by a homolog (PSPHL) hidden within the PSPH probe set. Among other significantly different genes were: for AA>CA, SOS1, AMFR, FGFR3; and for AA<CA, ARVCF, BIN3, EIF4B. Many more (221 transcripts for 204 genes) were differentially expressed at the more customary, less stringent threshold of FDR<.05. Using the biological systems approach, we identified shear response biology as being significantly altered for AA versus CA. It detected an apparent tonic increase of expression (AA>CA) for 46/157 genes within that system. Conclusions: The most significant single gene changes detected for AA involved genes having substantial, known roles in endothelial biology. Biological systems analysis suggested that shear stress response, a critical regulator of endothelial function and vascular homeostasis, may be different between AA and CA. These results potentially have direct implications for the role of endothelial cells in both vascular disease (e.g., hypertension and stroke) and cancer (via angiogenesis). The present findings are consistent with our overarching hypothesis that genetic influences stemming from ancestral continent-of-origin could impact upon endothelial cell biology and thereby contribute to disparity of vascular-related disease burden amongst AA.

Conclusions: The most significant single gene changes detected for AA involved genes having substantial, known roles in endothelial biology. Biological systems analysis suggested that shear stress response, a critical regulator of endothelial function and vascular homeostasis, may be different between AA and CA. These results potentially have direct implications for the role of endothelial cells in both vascular disease (e.g., hypertension and stroke) and cancer (via angiogenesis). The present findings are consistent with our overarching hypothesis that genetic influences stemming from ancestral continent-of-origin could impact upon endothelial cell biology and thereby contribute to disparity of vascular-related disease burden amongst AA. From self-identified, healthy, 20-29 year old AA (n=21) and CA (n=17), we established cultures of blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOEC) and applied microarray profiling. BOEC have never been exposed to in vivo influences, and their gene expression reflects culture conditions (meticulously controlled) and donor genetics. Analysis used two distinct approaches.

Results: At the highly stringent threshold of FDR=0, we identified 31 single genes that were differentially expressed, 4 higher and 27 lower in AA. AA exhibited the greatest fold-change (AA>CA), but this was entirely accounted for by a homolog (PSPHL) hidden within the PSPH probe set. Among other significantly different genes were: for AA>CA, SOS1, AMFR, FGFR3; and for AA<CA, ARVCF, BIN3, EIF4B.

A comparative gene expression profiling (GEP) was carried out on patient-derived MMECs and MGUS endothelial cells (MGECs) using the Affymetrix U133A Arrays. Expression of selective vascular markers were also validated by RT-PCR and immunoblotting analysis in primary cultures of ECs isolated from total bone marrow (BM)-mononuclear cells. Twenty-two genes were found differently expressed in MMECs compared to MGECs (with 14 down-regulated and 8 up-regulated), thus proving that molecular differences were maintained in vitro. Specific pathways analysis revealed transcriptional and protein expression changes for key regulators of extracellular matrix formation and bone remodeling, cell-adhesion, chemotaxis, angiogenesis, resistance to apoptosis, and cell-cycle regulation. Specifically, we focused on six of these genes (DIRAS3, SERPINF1, SRPX, BNIP3, IER3 and SEPW1), which were not previously functionally correlated to the overangiogenic phenotype of MMECs and disease activity. These data identified distinct EC gene expression profiles and some vascular phenotypes that could influence the remodeling of the BM-microenvironment in patients with active MM. A better understanding of the linkage between genetic and epigenetic events in MM tumor/ECs may contribute to the molecular classification of the disease, thereby identifying selective targets of more effective anti-vessel/stroma therapeutic strategies. Experiment Overall Design: This series of microarray experiments contains the gene expression profiles of five samples from HUVECs (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells) and five bone marrow ECs (endothelial cells) samples from newly diagnosed MGUS and MM patients, respectively. Centrifugation on Ficoll gradient of heparinized BM-aspirates was followed by polystyrene flask adherence to isolate stromal cells from plasma cells in suspension.

Freshly-isolated ECs were cultured in complete medium RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS and 1% glutamine to allow cell spreading and growth. The purity and viability of EC cultures grown at least one passage (more than 97% viable cells) were assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS, FACS Canto II, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) with double positivity for factor VIII-related antigen (FVIII-RA, a highly specific EC marker) and CD105 (or endoglyn, a molecule strongly expressed by ECs) as well as for CD14 and CD38 negativity. Analysis of mRNA transcripts for FVIII-RA, CD38, CD105 and IgH VDJ region was also performed by RT-PCR, and EC viability was assessed by trypan blue viable staining.

Twenty-two genes were found differently expressed in MMECs compared to MGECs (with 14 down-regulated and 8 up-regulated), thus proving that molecular differences were maintained in vitro. Specific pathways analysis revealed transcriptional and protein expression changes for key regulators of extracellular matrix formation and bone remodeling, cell-adhesion, chemotaxis, angiogenesis, resistance to apoptosis, and cell-cycle regulation. Specifically, we focused on six of these genes (DIRAS3, SERPINF1, SRPX, BNIP3, IER3 and SEPW1), which were not previously functionally correlated to the overangiogenic phenotype of MMECs and disease activity. These data identified distinct EC gene expression profiles and some vascular phenotypes that could influence the remodeling of the BM-microenvironment in patients with active MM. A better understanding of the linkage between genetic and epigenetic events in MM tumor/ECs may contribute to the molecular classification of the disease, thereby identifying selective targets of more effective anti-vessel/stroma therapeutic strategies. Experiment Overall Design: This series of microarray experiments contains the gene expression profiles of five samples from HUVECs (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells) and five bone marrow ECs (endothelial cells) samples from newly diagnosed MGUS and MM patients, respectively. Centrifugation on Ficoll gradient of heparinized BM-aspirates was followed by polystyrene flask adherence to isolate stromal cells from plasma cells in suspension. Adherent stromal elements were first immunodepleted of macrophages and residual plasma cells with CD14 and CD38 monoclonal antibody (mAb)-coated flasks (mAbs were from Immunotech, Coulter, Marseilles, France), and then incubated with magnetic microbeads coated with Ulex europaeus-1 lectin. Freshly-isolated ECs were cultured in complete medium RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS and 1% glutamine to allow cell spreading and growth. The purity and viability of EC cultures grown at least one passage (more than 97% viable cells) were assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS, FACS Canto II, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) with double positivity for factor VIII-related antigen (FVIII-RA, a highly specific EC marker) and CD105 (or endoglyn, a molecule strongly expressed by ECs) as well as for CD14 and CD38 negativity. Analysis of mRNA transcripts for FVIII-RA, CD38, CD105 and IgH VDJ region was also performed by RT-PCR, and EC viability was assessed by trypan blue viable staining. HUVECs were purchased from Clonetics Biowhittaker (Walkersville, MD) and cultured in EGM-2MV media (Clonetics Biowhittaker). Five micrograms of total RNA was processed and, in accordance with the manufacturer's protocols, 15 micrograms of fragmented biotin-labelled cRNA were hybridized on GeneChip Human Genome U133A Arrays (Affymetrix Inc.). The arrays were scanned using the Agilent GeneArray Scanner G2500A (Affymetrix). The images were acquired using Affymetrix MicroArray Suite (MAS) 5.0 software and the probe level data converted to expression values using the Bioconductor function for the Robust Multi-Array average (RMA) procedure (Irizarry et al, 2003), in which perfect match intensities are background adjusted, quantile-quantile normalized and log2-transformed.",Tumor endothelial cells,No

Specifically, we focused on six of these genes (DIRAS3, SERPINF1, SRPX, BNIP3, IER3 and SEPW1), which were not previously functionally correlated to the overangiogenic phenotype of MMECs and disease activity. These data identified distinct EC gene expression profiles and some vascular phenotypes that could influence the remodeling of the BM-microenvironment in patients with active MM. A better understanding of the linkage between genetic and epigenetic events in MM tumor/ECs may contribute to the molecular classification of the disease, thereby identifying selective targets of more effective anti-vessel/stroma therapeutic strategies. Experiment Overall Design: This series of microarray experiments contains the gene expression profiles of five samples from HUVECs (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells) and five bone marrow ECs (endothelial cells) samples from newly diagnosed MGUS and MM patients, respectively. Centrifugation on Ficoll gradient of heparinized BM-aspirates was followed by polystyrene flask adherence to isolate stromal cells from plasma cells in suspension. Adherent stromal elements were first immunodepleted of macrophages and residual plasma cells with CD14 and CD38 monoclonal antibody (mAb)-coated flasks (mAbs were from Immunotech, Coulter, Marseilles, France), and then incubated with magnetic microbeads coated with Ulex europaeus-1 lectin. Freshly-isolated ECs were cultured in complete medium RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS and 1% glutamine to allow cell spreading and growth. The purity and viability of EC cultures grown at least one passage (more than 97% viable cells) were assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS, FACS Canto II, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) with double positivity for factor VIII-related antigen (FVIII-RA, a highly specific EC marker) and CD105 (or endoglyn, a molecule strongly expressed by ECs) as well as for CD14 and CD38 negativity. Analysis of mRNA transcripts for FVIII-RA, CD38, CD105 and IgH VDJ region was also performed by RT-PCR, and EC viability was assessed by trypan blue viable staining. HUVECs were purchased from Clonetics Biowhittaker (Walkersville, MD) and cultured in EGM-2MV media (Clonetics Biowhittaker). Five micrograms of total RNA was processed and, in accordance with the manufacturer's protocols, 15 micrograms of fragmented biotin-labelled cRNA were hybridized on GeneChip Human Genome U133A Arrays (Affymetrix Inc.). The arrays were scanned using the Agilent GeneArray Scanner G2500A (Affymetrix). The images were acquired using Affymetrix MicroArray Suite (MAS) 5.0 software and the probe level data converted to expression values using the Bioconductor function for the Robust Multi-Array average (RMA) procedure (Irizarry et al, 2003), in which perfect match intensities are background adjusted, quantile-quantile normalized and log2-transformed.",Tumor endothelial cells,No

Here we investigated the global transcriptional gene response of primary human brain endothelial cells after incubation with high numbers of infected erythrocytes; High or low parasite binding phenotypes did not alter gene response. Predominate amongst signaling pathways were the NF-kB proinflammatory response. The inflammatory pathways were validated by direct measurement of proteins. This study delineates the strong inflammatory component of human brain endothelium contributing to cerebral malaria.

Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was prepared from 10 microgram total RNA using a double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit (Life Technologies) with a T7-dT24 primer for first-strand synthesis. cRNA was synthesized from cDNA and biotinylated using the BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit (Enzo Diagnostics). Twenty microgram of cRNA was fragmented by heating at 94°C for 35 min in fragmentation buffer, containing 40 mM Tris-acetate, pH 8.1, 125 mM KOAc, 30 mM MgOAc. Fifteen microgram of fragmented cRNA, together with control cRNAs and grid alignment oligonucleotides, were hybridized overnight to GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix) at 45°C under constant rotation. Arrays were washed and incubated with an anti-streptavidin antibody. Fluorescent signals were measured using an Agilent Gene Array Laser Scanner and analyzed with MicroArray Suite 5.0 (Affymetrix). Microarrays were scaled using default settings.",Metabolism | Heterogeneity | Infection and inflammatory response,No
